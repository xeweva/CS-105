# M02 - Midterm 02

## Overview

Midterm 02 is entirely a problem-focused exam. In this midterm, you will complete a combination of problems that will add up to the requisite maximum points (100 points). Most likely you will  do two problems

## Exam Rules And Hints

- You can use the following resources: 
  - Book, notes, 
  - slides from class, 
  - class code examples EXCEPT the Practice Exam Code (honor system),
  - internet searches EXCEPT searching for the solution itself
- You may not copy or save any portion of this test, so you must delete the test after submitting it. Be sure to verify that your work has been successfully pushed to GitHub before deleting
- If you are having trouble reading a diagram in the problem readme, then open the image directly from the images folder
-  It's easy to get overwhelmed by a problem. After understanding the basic objective for the exam, a good strategy is to first focus on the scaffolding from the UML: 1) classes; 2) attributes / instance variables; 3) operations / methods; 4) simple accessor / mutator implementations. After that, then focus on the logic components. It will be easier to get the logic done after the structure is in place because you can see what classes and methods you have to work with, plus you earn partial credit for the structure 

## Problem Combinations

- You can do either of the following:
  - **Problem1** (75 points) && **Problem2** (25 points) = 100. You can also attempt any other problems after this, but can only earn 10 extra credit points.
  - Any combination of **Problem3** - **Problem6** that equals 100 points. If you do more than 2 problems, the maximum points allowable is 10 extra credit.
- You cannot do both **Problem2** and **Problem3** as they are variants of the same problem

## Problems

[Problem1 - Timeclock (75 points)](readme-p1.md)

[Problem2 - Loan Eligibility Calculator (simplified) (25 points)](readme-p2.md)

[Problem3 - Loan Eligibility Calculator (complex) (50 points)](readme-p3.md)

[Problem4 - Area Estimator (50 points)](readme-p4.md)

[Problem5 - Investment Calculator (50 points)](readme-p5.md)

[Problem6 - Printer Status (25 points)](readme-p6.md)

## Creating and Testing Your Code for Each Problem

Each problem has its **own package** under the **src/edu/sbcc/cs105** folder (**p1 - p6**). You will create the classes for the problem in the problem package.  In each problem package, there is also a **Problem[n]**.java file with a **run** method.  If you want to create client code to run your code, create it in the **run** method. To then run that problem, change the **problem id** to the appropriate value (p1 - p6).

## Submitting Your Assignment

Follow the standard instructions for submitting a Java assignment: [How to Submit Assignments](https://canvas.sbcc.edu/courses/25771/pages/how-to-submit-assignments-new?module_item_id=761292). You do need to add the DONE tag.
